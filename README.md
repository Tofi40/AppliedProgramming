# RoomieMatch Monorepo

This repository contains a simplified scaffold for the RoomieMatch platform, including a .NET 9 backend and placeholder structures for the Angular frontend, infrastructure, and documentation assets.

## Structure
- `backend/`: ASP.NET Core Web API, EF Core models, matching engine, seed data, and controllers.
- `frontend/`: Placeholder for the Angular 20 application.
- `infra/`: Infrastructure-as-code, including Docker Compose.
- `docs/`: Documentation assets such as Postman collections.

## Getting Started
Due to environment limitations this scaffold focuses on backend components. Further work is required to complete the Angular frontend, tests, and CI pipelines.
